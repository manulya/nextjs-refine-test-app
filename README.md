# RESULTS

- **Candidate Management**: Users can view a list, view one, edit, and delete candidate profiles.
- **Pagination**: The candidate list includes pagination functionality.
- **Mock Authentication**: I have implemented a mock authentication system that encompasses:
  - **Registration**: Users can create an account using mock data.
  - **Login**: Users can log in to their accounts, with protected routes ensuring that only authenticated users can access certain areas of the application.
  - **Fake Password Change**: Users have the option to simulate changing their password.
  - **Logout**: Seamless logout functionality is available for users.
- **Interface Customization**: The application supports customization of the user interface, including theme switching options.

# Memposit NextJS Refine Test

Hello, fellow developer!

You are here to test your skills in creating frontend applications. 

## App description

You will write a small application that lets your users view candidates for their projects or other needs. Actually, we don't care about it in our app.

You can find the test data in `public/data.json`.

## Tasks

### Required

These are required tasks that you need to complete by the deadline:

- Create list candidates page
- Create view candidate page

### Optional

These are optional tasks that would be nice to have completed, but they are not your main focus:

- Add ability to create candidates
- Add ability to edit candidates
- Add ability to delete candidates
- Add "Sign In" functionality

## Deadline

The deadline will be discussed separately in private conversation.

## Evaluation

You will fork this repo and give us access to it by the deadline to evaluate your skills.

We will pay attention to:

- How much tasks was done by the deadline
- How clean the code is
- The ability to use new libraries and technologies / to navigate through docs
- How clean and nice your UI will look like without having the designs
